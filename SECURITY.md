# VendorHub OS - Security Documentation

## Overview

VendorHub OS is designed as a secure, multi-tenant SaaS platform for equipment finance operations. This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect sensitive financial data and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All database tables have comprehensive RLS policies
- **Organization Isolation**: Complete data separation between broker organizations
- **User Access Controls**: Role-based permissions (broker, loan_officer, vendor)

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: Enterprise-grade authentication with JWT tokens
- **Session Management**: Secure 24-hour sessions with automatic refresh
- **Password Policy**: 8+ chars with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive PII/financial data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive RLS policies
- **Secure Token Management**: Cryptographically secure invitation tokens

### API Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all API endpoints
- **CORS Protection**: Restricted origins, no wildcard access
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, XSS protection, clickjacking prevention
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage

### Infrastructure Security
- **Netlify Edge Functions**: Serverless architecture with built-in security
- **CDN Protection**: Global content delivery with DDoS protection
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security header implementation

## Security Features

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All database tables implement comprehensive RLS policies:

```sql
-- Example: Users can only access data from their organization
CREATE POLICY "Users can view deals in their organization" ON deals
    FOR SELECT USING (
        organization_id IN (
            SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE auth.uid() = id
        )
    );
```

### 2. Secure Invitation System

- **Cryptographic Tokens**: 256-bit secure random tokens
- **Token Hashing**: SHA-256 hashed tokens stored in database
- **Expiration**: Configurable token expiration (default 72 hours)
- **Single Use**: Tokens automatically invalidated after use

### 3. Input Validation

Comprehensive validation for all user inputs:
- Email format validation
- Password strength requirements
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack prevention
- Length and format restrictions

### 4. Audit Logging

Complete audit trail for compliance:
- All data modifications logged
- User actions tracked with IP addresses
- Retention policy for financial records (7 years)
- Immutable audit log entries

## Compliance Standards

### Financial Industry Compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data security
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley financial controls
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data privacy regulations

### Security Controls
- **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication ready
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit

X-XSS-Protection: XSS attack prevention
Referrer-Policy: Controls referrer information
Permissions-Policy: Restricts browser features
```

## Rate Limiting

Protection against abuse:
- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Registration**: 3 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **API Calls**: Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- **Invitation Validation**: Protected against token brute force

## Data Encryption

### Sensitive Data Encryption
- **SSN**: AES-256 encrypted
- **Bank Account Numbers**: AES-256 encrypted
- **Credit Scores**: AES-256 encrypted
- **Financial Documents**: Secure storage with encryption
